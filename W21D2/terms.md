Database Management System (DBMS) - A software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

Object Relational Mapper (ORM) - Connects object-oriented program (OOP) code with a database and simplifies relational database and OOP language interactions. We can write SQL queries by keying into class methods and we receive data from database queries as dictionaries.

Transaction - A set of database operations that are grouped together as a single entity. If a single one of the opereations fail, it is the default behavior to ROLLBACK, ensuring that no changes to the database are made. This helps to ensure the integrity of data within the database.
