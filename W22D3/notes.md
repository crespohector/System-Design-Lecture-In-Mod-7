# Reliability

## Challenges

### What factors contribute to the Reliability of an application?

### What constitutes good Error Handling? Should we develop our own Error Handling schema for our app?

### What is Quality Assurance (QA) and how does it help?

### Do we need comprehensive log files and if so, what should those include?

### What security considerations should we make?

### How does using a Version Control System help ensure the Reliability of our application?
