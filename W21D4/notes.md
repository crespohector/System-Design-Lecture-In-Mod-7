# Frontend to Backend Communication

## Challenges

Today we will be discussing the data-flow between our Frontend (Client-Side) and Backend code.

### Where is the frontend in development?

### Where is the frontend in production?
Kind of a trick question. In both cases the code is running in the client's browser, however the code is being served from different places in development and production.

### What protocol will the browser and server use to communicate with each other?

### Does our application need an Entry Point and if so, where is it?

### What is a bundler and what is it doing with our source code?

## What tool should we use to encode the data being sent to the server?
JSON!! vs XML

## Let's do an example of what the req / res data flow would look like with sending a GET and POST request.
