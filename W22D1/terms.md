Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - A form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. The provider of that service is responsible for maintaining the hardware that you will be paying to use as a customer. The customer is responsible for maintaining the application code or software that is running on that hardware! Examples: AWS, GCP, Azure.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) - A cloud computing model that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of infrastructure management. It sits between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) in the cloud computing service models. Examples: Render, Heroku, Netlifly.

Software as a Service (SaaS) - A cloud-based app accessible over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365). SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. AA centric examples: Discord, Slack, Salesforce.
